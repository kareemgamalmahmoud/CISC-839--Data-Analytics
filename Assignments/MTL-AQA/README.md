## Assignment #2

In A2, you would be given a dataset named MTL-AQA. You can download and
check the information of this dataset here: https://github.com/ParitoshParmar/
MTL-AQA. MTL-AQA contains data related to a task named Action Quality Assessment (AQA). AQA aims to evaluate how well an action performs, i.e., predict score
from a given video. It is a significant problem with applications in many domains,
including healthcare (e.g., evaluate the progress of patients in performing certain
rehabilitation tasks or train the personnel for performing medical procedures) and
sports (e.g., to help athletes improve their performance).
You are allowed to read the paper associated with this dataset and reuse their code
with references.


(1) (10 marks) Form a semi-supervised AQA task from this data, describe how you would
design the experiment setup for evaluating a semi-supervised learning approach on your
proposed task, provide a valid solution (e.g., model architecture) for your experiment
setup.

(2) (4 marks-Bonus Point) Implement your proposed semi-supervised AQA solution (in a
jupyter notebook).

(3) (10 marks) Read the paper titled “What and How Well You Performed? A Multitask
Learning Approach to Action Quality Assessment”, summarize their paper by answering

1) how they form a multi-task learning task from the given dataset? 
2) besides their
proposed multi-task learning problem, do you think other multi-task problems can be
formed from the AQA context? Give at least one example. 
3) provide another application
that can benefit from their multi-task learning approach
