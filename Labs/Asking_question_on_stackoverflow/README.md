# Lab_1 : Asking Question on StackOverFlow

Stack Overflow is one of the most helpful and most visited websites on the internet, but it is also one of the most brutal platforms on the internet. People will show no mercy if we make a mistake, and that’s how the platform has maintained its standards ever since its inception. So, don’t expect anything less.

## Task 1:
-The given dataset is a table containing questions about R on StackOverflow site.

-Your first task is to perform standard text prepossessing steps introduced in lectures for future tasks.

-You can perform analysis on title or body of the questions.


## Task 2:

- Using existing libraries, such as gensim to learn word embeddings from the prepossessed text from previous step.

- At the end of this step, you should save the learned word embeddings in a file.

## Task 3:

- Perform topic analysis on the prepossessed textual data.

- Briefly specify how you pick the number of topics.
